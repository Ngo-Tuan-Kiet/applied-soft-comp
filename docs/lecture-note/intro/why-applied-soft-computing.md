# Why applied soft computing? 

Imagine you're trying to recognize your friend's face in a photo. Your brain does this effortlessly, but try writing down the exact rules for recognizing a face. Should you measure the distance between the eyes? The shape of the nose? The curve of the smile? You'll quickly realize that writing explicit rules for face recognition is nearly impossible.

This is where applied soft computing shine. Instead of following rigid rules, they learn and use "soft rules" that allows imperfection and uncertainty, much like how we humans brain works.
This course focuses on a powerful soft computing framework, ***neural networks***. 

# The Power of Neural Networks

Neural networks are transforming our society in ways that were once confined to science fiction. Let's explore why they're special and how they're changing our world.

## What makes neural networks great?

Imagine teaching a child to recognize cats. You don't give them a rulebook of whisker lengths or ear shapes. Instead, you show them cats – lots of cats. Orange cats, black cats, sleeping cats, running cats. Soon, they can spot cats even in situations they've never seen before, like a cat wearing a Halloween costume or a cat partially hidden behind a plant.

Neural networks learn in a remarkably similar way. They don't need explicit rules like "if ears are triangular AND whiskers are present AND..." Instead, they learn from examples, just like humans do, handle noisy, imperfect data gracefull, and generalize to new situations they haven't seen before


# How neural networks are transforming our lives

Think back to just a decade ago in healthcare. Doctors would pour over medical textbooks, following rigid decision trees to diagnose diseases. "If the patient shows symptom A and lab result B is above threshold C, then consider diagnosis D." But human bodies are incredibly complex, and these rigid rules often fell short. Now, neural networks are revolutionizing how we approach healthcare. In hospitals around the world, they're examining medical images with remarkable precision, often spotting subtle signs of cancer that even experienced doctors might miss. These systems aren't replacing doctors – they're giving them powerful new tools to make better decisions.

But the impact goes far beyond just looking at images. By learning from millions of patient records, neural networks are uncovering hidden patterns in how diseases progress and how patients respond to treatments. When a doctor is deciding on a treatment plan, these insights help them understand what might work best for each unique patient. In research laboratories, neural networks are accelerating the discovery of new medicines by analyzing vast databases of molecular structures and predicting which combinations might lead to effective new drugs.

The most exciting part is how neural networks are pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Scientists are using them to unlock the mysteries of protein folding – a fundamental challenge in biology that resisted traditional approaches for decades. By understanding how proteins fold, we're opening new doors to treating diseases that once seemed untreatable. It's like having a powerful microscope that not only lets us see tiny details but also helps us understand how all these details work together.

And this is just the beginning. Every day, researchers are finding new ways to apply neural networks to solve problems that once seemed impossible. They're helping us understand climate patterns, discover new materials, compose music, and even explore the depths of space. Just as the invention of the microscope transformed our understanding of the microscopic world, neural networks are transforming our ability to see and understand patterns in the vast complexity of our modern world.

Just as the invention of writing transformed how humans preserve and share knowledge, neural networks are transforming how we process and understand the world around us. They're not just tools – they're partners in pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
