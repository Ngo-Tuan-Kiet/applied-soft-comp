# Welcome to SSIE 541/441 Applied Soft Computing

``Don't think! Feeeeeel'' is a famous quote by Bruce Lee in the movie *Enter the Dragon*, and this is my guiding philosophy of learning.

This course is designed to help you *feel* the concepts and tools of applied soft computing through pen-and-paper exercises and hands-on coding.
